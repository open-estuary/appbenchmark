# Estuary Application Benchmark Test 
## <a name="1">Introduction</a>
It is to maintain application benchmark test scripts including:
- Scripts which setup server and client 
- Scripts which perform benchmark test  

## <a name="2">Benchmark Test</a>
Usually it is only necessary to execute following commands in order to perform benchmark test for each application:
- `./setup.sh` to setup client and server side;
- `./run_{test/xxx}.sh` to perform benchmark test on client side

Currently the following applications have been supported so far :
- Basic Test
  - CPU
    - [SpecInt20016](https://github.com/open-estuary/appbenchmark/tree/master/apps/cpu/spec_cpu2006)
  - IO
    - [FIO](https://github.com/open-estuary/appbenchmark/tree/master/apps/io/fio)
    - [Sysbench](https://github.com/open-estuary/appbenchmark/tree/master/apps/io/sysbench)
  - Memory
